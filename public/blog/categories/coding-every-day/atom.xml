    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today. I begin my challenge to write code daily(outside of the code I write for work). The main problem with this decision is that I often don't believe the code that I write just-for-fun to be "publish worthy".</p>

<p>However, this way, the big brother effect will kick in and allow me improve my daily coding while (hopefully) helping out someone out there. As a result, you will see my newly renamed github (from anebg to abrutus) grow on a daily basis, and this blog will contain short snippets and explanations. Because this is such a big commitment, I command you as a reader and programmer to do the same, and I will link to your blog(yes, you are my new accountability partner).</p>

<p>So my plan is to pick up a book on a langugage I know next to nothing about (scala/clojure) and mark-down notes here for everyone's reference.</p>

<p>Wish me luck!</p>
