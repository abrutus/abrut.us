    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Say you want to start a project and you want to use Heroku for your quick 'proof of concept'.
You will need virtual environment.</p>

<p>On my Mac 10.8.2, I did:</p>

<p><code>
sudo easy_install virtualenv
sudo easy_install pip
</code>
Then to create the virtual environment called venv (while on my project folder):
<code>
virtualenv --distribute venv
</code>
Then to activate the virutal environment:
<code>
source venv/bin/activate
</code>
By now, my propmt's prefix would be appended with (venv) and I am inside my virtual environment. I can now proceed to install Django, by executing
<code>
pip install Django
</code>
After installing Django, I can freeze the requirements so Heroku would know which packages to install whenever I do a push by executing</p>

<p><code>
pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt
</code>
and adding the output file(requirements.txt) to the repository.</p>

<p>By using a virtualenv, you can have different projects use different python installations(2.x and 3.x) in a single development machine, and also replicate your exact production environment. Heroku uses the requirements file to install the specific versions of the modules which in turn makes everything a replica of your development environment.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I begin my challenge to write code daily(outside of the code I write for work). The main problem with this decision is that I often don't believe the code that I write just-for-fun to be "publish worthy".</p>

<p>However, this way, the big brother effect will kick in and allow me improve my daily coding while (hopefully) helping out someone out there. As a result, you will see my newly renamed github (from anebg to abrutus) grow on a daily basis, and this blog will contain short snippets and explanations. Because this is such a big commitment, I command you as a reader and programmer to do the same, and I will link to your blog(yes, you are my new accountability partner).</p>

<p>So my plan is to pick up a book on a langugage I know next to nothing about (scala/clojure) and mark-down notes here for everyone's reference.</p>

<p>Wish me luck!</p>
