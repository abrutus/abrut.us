Today. I begin my challenge to write code daily(outside of the code I write for work). The main problem with this decision is that I often do not believe the code that I write just-for fun to be "publish worthy". 

However, this way, the big brother effect will kick in and allow me improve my daily coding while (hopefully) helping out someone out there. As a result, you will see my newly renamed github (from anebg to abrutus) grow on a daily basis, and this blog will contaih short snippets and explanations. Because this is such a big commitment, I command you as a reader and programmer to do the same, and I will link to your blog(yes, you are my new accountability partner).

So my plan is to pick up a book on a langugage I know next to nothing about (scala/clojure) and mark-down notes here for everyone's reference. 

Wish me luck!
