```
Context: Job 13
```
When Job pleas to God, he calls to God and asks God to charge him with sinfulness if he finds any, knowing that he will be vindicated by his lack of sin: 
>18Now that I have prepared my case, I know I will be vindicated.

>19Can anyone bring charges against me? If so, I will be silent and die.

But then, an interesting verse happens:
> 26For you write down bitter things against me
and make me reap the sins of my youth.

And this verse makes think of a question: Does God treat 'sins of the youth' any differently? 
But hold on, this whole time, I believed Job to be a perfect man, God himself said in Job 1:8
>“Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is **blameless and upright**, a man who fears God and shuns evil.”

And now(13 chapters later), I hear that Job had 'sins of his youth'. 

At first, I was disappointed. But then, being like Job suddenly became more human.
If anything, this makes me believe in the power of God to forgive(and forget): Job sinned while in his youth, came to God and became **blameless and upright**.
