You've landed. Here I blog mostly about issues that arise out of the technology I employ(Django, CodeIgniter, jQuery, Bootstrap) and the ones I'm learning (Scala and Ruby). Ocassionally, you'll hear me describe architectures.
Drop me a line in the comments, twitter or github. I'll be around **(I promise)**

And here is a hello world for syntax highlighting:
{% codeblock lang:scala %}
// Operator for Overloading
object operator
{
  def operation(a: Int, b: Int) = {
    a+b
  } 
}
{% endcodeblock %}
